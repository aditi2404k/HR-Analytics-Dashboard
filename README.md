# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

This is an HR Analytics Dashboard I created using Power BI Desktop to explore and visualize key HR metrics in a meaningful way. The goal of this project was to analyze employee data and surface insights that can help HR teams make more informed, data-driven decisions.

-What I Did:
I started by importing and cleaning the dataset in Power BI, using Power Query to shape the data and remove any inconsistencies.

I created custom measures using DAX to calculate metrics such as Attrition Rate, Attrition Count, and Average Daily Rate.

I used slicer tiles to allow interactive filtering by fields like Department, Age Group, and Business Travel.

I organized the dashboard to give a clear overview of:

Employee demographics (Age, Gender, Department, Education, etc.)

Attrition trends across departments and age groups

Employee satisfaction levels (Environment Satisfaction, Job Satisfaction)

Financial metrics like Daily Rate

Distance from home insights to explore commuting trends
